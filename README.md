# Parking Lot Simulation

## Overview

This project is a web-based parking lot simulation developed purely using HTML and CSS animations. It visualizes a dynamic parking lot where cars move in and out of parking spaces.

## Features

- **Realistic Parking Lot Layout**: The simulation features a detailed layout of a typical parking lot, complete with individual parking spaces.
- **Animated Car Movements**: Cars are animated using CSS to move in and out of the parking lot, providing a realistic simulation of a busy parking area.
- **Responsive Design**: The simulation is fully responsive, working on various devices and screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Simulation**: Load the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the simulation.
2. **View Car Movements**: Watch as cars enter and exit the parking lot.
3. **Interact**: Currently, interaction is limited as the simulation runs automatically.

## How It Works

- The parking lot and cars are designed using HTML and CSS.
- CSS animations are used to move cars in and out of the parking spaces.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding user interaction to control car movements.
- Implementing JavaScript for more complex animations and interactions.
